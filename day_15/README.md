# Day 15: Read Object Model & Create FarmState Struct

## What You'll Learn Today

Today you'll start your third project: **Farm Simulator**. You'll learn:
- What Sui objects are (conceptually)
- How to create a simple struct for counters
- Basic increment operations

## Understanding Sui Objects (Concept)

A **Sui object** is a special type of struct that:
- Can be owned by an address
- Can be transferred between addresses
- Has a unique ID (UID)
- Can be stored on-chain

**Today's Note:** We're NOT creating a Sui object yet! We're just creating a regular struct. We'll add UID and make it an object tomorrow.

## Farm Updates

The farm includes plotId support:
- **PlotId validation**: PlotIds must be between 1 and 20
- **Plot tracking**: A vector tracks all planted plots
- **Duplicate prevention**: Cannot plant the same plotId twice
- **Limit enforcement**: Maximum of 20 plots
- **Harvest validation**: Cannot harvest plots that don't exist

All functions now take `plotId: u8` parameters.

## Your Task

1. Open `sources/main.move`
2. Define constants for plotId validation and error codes
3. Define a `FarmCounters` struct with:
   - `planted: u64`
   - `harvested: u64`
   - `plots: vector<u8>`
4. Add `copy`, `drop`, and `store` abilities (store is needed for objects later)
5. Write `new_counters()`, `plant(plotId: u8)`, and `harvest(plotId: u8)` functions with plotId validation

- **Day 17** - Entry functions and object ownership

## Entry Functions Guide (Coming Up)

Starting from Day 17, you'll learn about **entry functions** - special functions that can be called directly from explorers(e.g. https://suiscan.xyz). Here's what you need to know:

### What are Entry Functions?

Entry functions are the public interface of your Sui module. They:
- Can be called directly from explorers
- Are marked with the `entry` keyword
- Must take `&mut TxContext` as the last parameter (if they create objects)
- Are what users interact with when using your module

### Basic Entry Function Pattern

```move
entry fun create_something(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    // Create an object
    let obj = Object {
      id: object::new(ctx)
    };
    // Transfer it to the sender
    transfer::transfer(obj, ctx.sender());
}
```

### Entry Functions for Object Operations

When you want to modify an object, your entry function receives the object:

```move
entry fun update_object(obj: &mut MyObject) {
    // Modify the object
    obj.field = new_value;
}
```

### Sending Transactions

<!-- Screenshots will be added here -->

You'll learn more about entry functions in Days 17-21!
